**StoryBench** is an evaluation dataset for narrative text-to-image (T2I) generation, characterized by its diversity, explainability, and multi-hop nature. It consists of 728 prompts across five categories: animal-nature, labor, medical, sport, and technology. The assessment of five prominent T2I models, including DALLÂ·E 3 and Midjourney, has revealed that even advanced T2I models have limited capability in generating complex event-narrative images.
