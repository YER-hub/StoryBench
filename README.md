# ðŸ“š StoryBench

**StoryBench** is an evaluation dataset for narrative text-to-image (T2I) generation, characterized by its diversity, explainability, and multi-hop nature. It consists of 728 prompts across five categories: animal-nature, labor, medical, sport, and technology. The assessment of five prominent T2I models, including DALLÂ·E 3 and Midjourney, has revealed that even advanced T2I models have limited capability in generating complex event-narrative images.

Currently, we are in the process of refining and perfecting the dataset and related code to ensure their quality and usability. We will release these resources on GitHub in the near future.
